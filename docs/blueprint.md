## Style Guidelines:

- Primary gradient: transitioning from #8CC63F to #0F5B31 to #009CA6 to #004B66. This creates a visually appealing and eco-friendly brand image.
- Neutrals: Using #FFFFFF (white) for clean backgrounds, a textured light grey (paper-like) to bring some warm, and #012417 for dark mode backgrounds to highlight content and improve readability.
- Accents: Applying #8CC63F (lime) for active elements, providing clear visual cues for interaction. #009CA6 (turquoise) for hover states and interactive feedback.
- Use 'Inter' or 'Plus Jakarta Sans' (both sans-serif) from Google Fonts for a modern, clean, and accessible typography that suits headlines and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- lucide-react: Employing open-source, MIT-licensed icons throughout the application for a consistent and modern visual language. They will integrate seamlessly to be simple, accessible and eco friendly.
- Utilizing a clean, minimalist layout to emphasize content. Implement accessible dark mode with clear distinction and an easy toggle.
- Apply subtle animations to highlight element transitions and give useful user feedback without distractive animation that may deter from completing the intended actions. These can provide users with more visual orientation and help the users learn more by not deterring form content readability.
